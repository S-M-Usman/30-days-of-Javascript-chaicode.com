# Day 4: Loops

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: For Loop
- **Task 1**: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

### Activity 2: While Loop
- **Task 3**: Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
- **Task 4**: Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

### Activity 3: Do...While Loop
- **Task 5**: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
- **Task 6**: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

### Activity 4: Nested Loops
- **Task 7**: Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops: (ignore color)

### Activity 5: Loop Control Statements
- **Task 8**: Write a program that uses the `break` statement to exit a loop when a certain condition is met.
- **Task 9**: Write a program that uses the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration and proceed with the next iteration of the loop.

## Feature Request:
1. **Number Printing Script**: Write a script to print numbers from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 using for, while, and do...while loops.
2. **Multiplication Table Script**: Create a script to print the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.
3. **Sum Calculation Script**: Write a script to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
4. **Factorial Calculation Script**: Create a script to calculate the factorial of a given number using a do...while loop.
5. **Pattern Printing Script**: Write a script to print a specified pattern using nested loops.
6. **Loop Control Script**: Create a script that demonstrates the use of `break` and `continue` statements in loops.

## Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and implement basic for, while, and do...while loops.
- Use loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Apply nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Utilize `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution flow.
